## Understanding the Variations of Water Use Efficiency across Europe over the Last 100 Years
#### Weiwei Zhan (wz2483)

This repo stores the codes for the QMDA project and is trying to explore the temporal variations of water use efficiency across the Europe continent based on the tree-ring data.

The notebook files(`.ipynb`) are numbered according to the order of data processing. 
* The 1st file contains codes to do trend analysis for the time series of iWUE, Ci, and Ci/Ca ratio;
* The 2nd file contains codes to apply a High-pass filter on the original iWUE series;
* The 3rd file is to read and pre-process the CRU climatic dataset;
* The 4th file is to do correlation analysis between the 50-year high-pass filtered iWUE and monthly climatic drivers
* The 5th file is to fit an empirical model to reveal the relative sensitivity of WUE to Ca and VPD
